## Synopsis

This program was supposed to take a string input by a user and modify it based on which switches had been turned on. Then the result would be easily copied onto the clipboard by the press of a single button. Unfortunately I did not manage to get this working before the deadline.

## Installation

Tested on iOS 9.2 running on a simulated iPhone 5s in Xcode 7.2. Open in Xcode and Run simulation to emulate.
